# What makes something functional?
What makes code "functional", as in functional programming, over "imperative"?

If it's the language then there it is. You have it.

I think tha't a copy out tho.

It isn't ADTs because you can impliment those in ANY language. Which is excellent.

I'd argue, for the sake of simplicity, that it's higher order functions, partial application or currying and composition.
