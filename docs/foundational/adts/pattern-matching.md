# Pattern Matching

?> Pattern matching is about defining how to process a value given its structure.

Just wanted to go into this a bit more.

I need to really get into this because this is important to know but it isn't

1. How to achieve a type definition
1. How plain JavaScript makes this difficult
1. Options for doing this in plain JavaScript
1. Options for doing this in plain TypeScript (someone help me here plz)
1. Future options
