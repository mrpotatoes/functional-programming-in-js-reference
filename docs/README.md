# Functional programming in JS reference

There is so much to functional programming. There is math, theory, actual code and so, many, many, many different languages & libraries. Even getting started is difficult. I hope to be able to help

So, if you're interested in JS and in functional programming and aren't getting all the information that you want then I hope that I can be that resource. My intention with this wiki/book/blog that this can be a comprehensive FP reference for all (in JavaScript). Well, one can dream.

To be clear this will be comprehensive for topics and baseline knowledge to learn. I will try my best to make it as easy to understand (from my perspective) as possible. Every page will have it's own set of links in it's bibliography/citations section at the bottom. I do not presume to know the most or more than anyone else. This is for me to learn and I hope it's useful for others as well.

The code can be found in the repo under `./src`

Note: Feel free to correct me if I'm wrong on anything. Either on twitter [@andriclibresinn](https://twitter.com/andriclibresinn) or put it into a `pull request`.
