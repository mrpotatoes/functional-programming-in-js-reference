# Functional programming in JS reference

So, if you're here you are interested in JS and you are just not getting all the information that you want. So I hope that this can be a comprehensive FP reference. Well, one can dream.

To be clear this will be conprehensive for topics and baseline knowledge to learn. I will try my best to make it as easy to understand (from my perspective) as possible. Every page will have it's own set of links in it's bibliography/citations section at the bottom. I do not presume to know the most or more than anyone else. This is for me to learn and I hope it's useful for others as well.

The code can be found in the repo under `./src`

Note: Feel free to correct me if I'm wrong on anything. Either on twitter [@andriclibresinn](https://twitter.com/andriclibresinn) or put it into a `pull request`.
