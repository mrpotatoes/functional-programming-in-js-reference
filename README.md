# [Functional Programming in JS Reference](https://mrpotatoes.github.io/functional-programming-in-js-reference/)

This is the github repo for the site AND the source code that is showed on the site.

I recommend going to the site if you want to learn more about functional programming (head is link) otherwise if you want to look at the source goto the `./src` folder.
