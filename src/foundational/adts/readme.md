This is the code implimentaiton of the documetation here: https://mrpotatoes.github.io/functional-programming-in-js-reference/#/foundational/adts/explain

This code will illustrate 2 things.

1. How the code works for a custom `Daggy` library.
2. Use the actual `Daggy` to pass the same tests as the custom one.

The rest of the code in this suite will use the actual daggy library not my custom made one.
