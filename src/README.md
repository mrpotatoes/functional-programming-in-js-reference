# Functional Programming Reference Guide
There is a lot of code and tests in here. All this code is to illustrate all the articles in the wiki.

The code nor the tests are meant to be exhaustive. This was meant to learn (me) and to teach (everyone else maybe, hopefully).

*Do not* use any of this code in production.
